            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Homeless Period Ireland is a service that provides sanitary products to women experiencing homelessness in Ireland. Our team redesigned physical and digital touchpoints to facilitate the donations of hygienic products such as tampons and pads.
                It used social media and branding to increase awareness and promote government action on this problem.</p>

        <div class="project-challenge">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>It is that dreaded time of the month for homeless women or women in crisis. They usually have no choice but to go with limited or no access to sanitary products. This initiative believes that tampons and towels should be available to all women.
                Homeless Period Ireland allowed my colleagues and me to make a difference by facilitating a holistic service for women in need and bringing awareness to their campaign.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>We started this project by researching Dublin and interviewing women in need and volunteers working in several homeless organizations. We began by interviewing the founder of the service and continued through to the volunteers of the service
                and local shelters and women who have experienced or were experiencing homelessness.</p>

                donations stations.</p>

            <p>We also created branded donation stations in Fusion 360, a 3D modelling software; this ensured that they could be flat packaged and shipped to any location quickly. The colours meant donators could be easily spotted, securing donations arrived
                successfully.
