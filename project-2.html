            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <P>Namastay is a research project I undertook with Silvercloud, a mental health online platform. This project aimed to highlight how mindfulness applications can cater to users who want to learn to meditate and monitor their progress through
                guided micro-interactions.</P>
        </div>
        <div class="project-challenge">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The challenge for most users utilising meditation apps is that users typically want to try and activate a state of flow to achieve a meditative state. Through research, I found that the apps currently on the market weren't doing that, and
                users felt that the apps weren't very emotional.</p>

            <h2>Research Synthesis</h2>
            <p>After my interviews, I was able to gain some insights as to what it was that I could design. "Maybe having a response to something when someone does the mindfulness exercises. There's a lot of variability in those solutions." This insight
                got me thinking of interactions and responsiveness, which according to what users say about the current apps on the market, were "lifeless and unemotional."</p>

            <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
            <p>Through a user journey map, I was able to identify how users would experience Namastay over some time, so I can maximise the user experience if any issues occur. The user journey map allowed me to recognise that users might like to have features
                like turning the apps audio off and the voice recording feature to monitor their progress.</p>

                take throughout the application.</p>

            <p>For this project, I wanted to encapsulate everything that is art therapy, meditation and self reflection down to it very abstracted concept so that it could be interjected into little moments throughout someones day in app form.</p>
            <div class="project-solution">
                <p>After speaking to Caroline and Helena and my users, I was able to have them test the final prototype. I'm confident this was achieved with my final concept. They felt as though the app was successful in achieving the goals of expression,
                    meditation through the animations.</p>
